                most definitely have something in mind you'll love.

            <h2>About Her</h2>
            <img src="imgs/drawing.jpg" alt="earrings">
            <p>On her free time she loves to sing, dance, make her earrings, have fun, go out and pretty much everything you can think of.
                She's my favorite person in the world and I want to always make her happy and smile whenever I can. we spend time almost everyday and when we can't we video call and watch a movie on discord.
                I really hope this makes her happy to see and shows a little of what she means to me, I'm so prouf of her and her creativeness,
                I plan on marrying her in the future.</p>
